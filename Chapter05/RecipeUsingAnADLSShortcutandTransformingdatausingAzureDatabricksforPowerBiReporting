#Copy and paste the following script into your new notebook. Then, execute the following
#Python script in your notebook to create a Delta table within your ADLS Gen2 account. This
#script reads sample Parquet data and then writes it as a Delta table into your ADLS account:
# Adjust the file path to point to your sample parquet data
#using the following format:

"abfss://<storage name>@<container name>.dfs.core.windows.net/<filepath>"
# The line below reads Parquet files from your ADLS account

df = spark.read.format('Parquet').load("abfss://datasetsv1@olsdemo.dfs.core.windows.net/demo/full/dimension_city/")
#This line writes the read data as Delta tables back into your
ADLS account
