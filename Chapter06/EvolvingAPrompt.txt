INITIAL PROMPT
Explain the process of battery generation in simple terms.

REFINED PROMPT
Can you break down the process into simpler steps for a middle school science class?

ADVANCED PROMPT
You are an engineering teacher. Create a detailed lesson plan to teach battery design to students using a practical experiment. The lesson plan should include the following elements:
1.	An overview of the battery design principles that will be covered.
2.	A list of materials needed for the experiment.
3.	A step-by-step guide for conducting the experiment, including:
•	Preparation of materials.
•	Assembly of a simple galvanic cell.
•	Variations using different materials and electrolytes.
•	Data collection and analysis.
•	Discussion of results and conclusions.
4.	Introduction to battery components and their roles.
5.	Advanced considerations such as energy density, environmental impact, and safety.
6.	Follow-up activities to reinforce learning and explore advanced topics.
